<Section title="Clicker training">
	<p>
		Clicker training is a method of animal training that uses a sound (a click) to tell an animal
		when he does something right. The clicker is a tiny plastic box with a metal tongue that you
		push quickly to make a clicking sound. Most people who’ve heard of the clicker know that it’s a
		popular tool for dog trainers, but clickers can be used to train all kinds of animals, both wild
		and domestic - from lions to elephants to household rats, cats and birds!
	</p>
	<SubSection title="How does it work?">
		<p>
			The clicker creates an efficient language between a human trainer and an animal trainee.
			First, a trainer teaches an animal that every time she hears the clicking sound, she gets a
			treat. Once the animal understands that clicks are always followed by treats, the click
			becomes as powerful a reward as money is to people. When this happens, the trianer can use the
			click to mark (identify for the animal) the instant the animal performs the right behavior.
			For example, if a trainer wants to teach a dog to sit, she’ll click the instant her rump hits
			the floors and then deliver a tasty treat. With repetition, the dog learns that sitting earns
			rewards.
		</p>
		<p>
			So the click takes on a huge meaning. To the animal, it means: “what was I doing the moment my
			trainer clicked, that’s what she wants me to do!” The clicker in animal training is like the
			winning buzzer on a game show that tells a contestant she just won money! Through the clicker,
			the trianer communicates precisely with the dog, and that speeds up the training.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Giving the clicker meaning">
		<p>
			It’s easy to introduce the clicker to your pet. Spend thirty minutes or so teaching her that
			the sound of the click means “treat!” For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume you are going
			to clicker train a dog.
		</p>
		<ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
			<li>
				Sit and watch TV or read a book with your dog in the room. Have a container within reach.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place one treat in your hand and the clicker int he other. If your dog smells the treat and
				tries to get is by pawing, sniffing, mouthing, or barking at your, just close your hand
				around the treat and wait until he gives up and leaves you alone.
			</li>
			<li>
				Click once and immediately open your hand to give your dog the treat. Put another treat in
				your closed hand and resume watching TV or reading. Ignore your dog.
			</li>
			<li>Several minutes later, click and offer another treat.</li>
			<li>
				Continue to repeat the click-and-treat combination at varying intervals, sometimes after one
				minutes, sometimes after five minutes. Make sure you vary the time so that your dog doesn’t
				know exactly when he neck click is coming. Eventually, she’ll start to turn towards you and
				look expectant when she hears the click - which means she understands that the sound of the
				clicker means at treat is coming her way.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Troubleshooting">
		<p>
			If your pet runs away when he hears the click, you can make the sound softer by putting it in
			your pocket or wrapping a towel around your hand that’s holding the clicker. You can also try
			using a different sound, like the click of a retractable pen or the words “yes” or “bingo.”
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Clicker training basics">
		<p>
			Once your dog seems to understand the connection between the click and the treat, you’re ready
			to get started. Keep these guidelines in mind to ensure your clicker training success:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>
				Click just once, right when your pet does what you want him to do. Think of it like pressing
				the shutter of a camera to take a picture of a behavior.
			</li>
			<li>
				Remember to follow every click with a treat. After you click, deliver the treat to your
				pet’s mouth as quickly as possible.
			</li>
			<li>
				It’s fine to switch between practicing two or three behaviors within a session, but work on
				one behavior at a time. For example, say you’re teaching a dog to sit, lie down, and raise
				paw. You can do ten repetitions of sit and take a quick play break. Then do ten repetitions
				of down, and take another quick break. Then do ten repetitions of down, and so on.
			</li>
			<li>
				Animals, like children, have short attention spans. Keep training sessions short (15 minutes
				or less), and stop before you or your pet gets tired of the game.
			</li>
			<li>
				End training sessions on a good note, when your pet has succeeded with what you’re working
				on. If necessary, ask him to do something you know he can do well at the end of a session.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some trainers like a click and then deliver a “jackpot” (a bunch of treats) when their pet
				has accomplished a particularly challenging task. Big efforts deserve big rewards!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Catching behavior">
		<p>
			Catching means that you catch your pet in the act of doing the behavior you want. It’s the
			perfect method for training behaviors that your pet already does on her own, like sitting,
			lying down, and maybe rolling over in the grass. For example, if you want to train your dog to
			lie down, you can stand in your living room with your dog and just wait. After a little while,
			your dog will probably decide to lie down and get comfortable. The instant his body hits the
			floor, click and toss a treat on the ground a few feet in front of him. He’ll have to stand up
			to take the treat, so after he eats it, you’ll be ready to start over again. Continue the
			sequence of waiting for your dog to lie down on his own, and then clicking and tossing a treat
			the moment he does. With repetition, your dog will eventually look at your and throw herself
			not he ground to earn her treat.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Shaping behavior">
		<p>
			With shaping, you gradually build a new behavior by clicking and rewarding a series of small
			steps towards it. Shaping is a good method for training new behaviors (or a series of
			behaviors called a “chain”) that your pet doesn’t already do on her own - like raising a paw
			in the air, retrieving a ball, or going to a specific lie down. You start by rewarding the
			first small behavior that begins you pet on his journey towards the complete behavior. When
			he’s mastered the first step, you ask a little more from him - require him to do the next
			small step to earn his click and treat. For example, to get a dog to raise her paw, you might
			start by clicking and treating several repetitions, you delay clicking until you see her lift
			her front paw off the floor just one inch. When she’s good at tiny paw raises, delay your
			click again require her to raise her paw another inch or two higher to earn her click and
			treat. By reinforcing each tiny step as if it were the ultimate goal, your dog will think that
			learning is fun and will soon be performing the goal behavior with enthusiasm.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Luring behavior">
		<p>
			Luring involves using a treat like a magnet or guide to get your pet into a desired position.
			The food lure (a small piece of tasty food) is held right infant of your pet’s nose and then
			moved while he follows it. For example, to lure a dog into a down position, hold a piece of
			food in front of her nose and then slowly draw it straight down in front of her chest to the
			floor. The food will work like a magnet, drawing your dog’s nose and then her body downward.
			As her elbows touch the floor, click and treat for the down. After some practice, you can just
			use the hand motion to prompt your dog to lie down. Make the same movement as before, but with
			no treat in your hand. Over many repetitions, you can gradually make this hand signal smaller
			and shorter. Eventually, your dog will lie down when you point to the ground. Lure and reward
			training is often quicker and more efficient than catching or shaping to get and reward
			certain behaviors.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Adding the cue">
		<p>
			Whether you’ve used catching, shaping or luring to get a behavior you want, your next step is
			to add a cue or command. If you’ve used luring, you’ll know when you’re ready when your pet
			consistently does the behavior you want as soon as you give your hand signal. If you’ve used
			catching or shaping, you can add the cue when your pet is confidently offering the behavior
			over and over without any other behaviors in between.
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>
				First say the cue word you’d like to use. <span class="italic"
					>Say it only once - don’t nag!</span
				>
			</li>
			<li>
				Then ask or wait for the behavior. Use your hand signal to prompt your pet if you were
				luring. If you used catching or shaping, you’ll just wait after you give the cue for your
				pet to offer the behavior.
			</li>
			<li>Click and treat the instant your pet performs the behavior.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Good timing is essential. Be sure to say your cue <span class="italic">before</span> your pet does
			the behavior you want, not at the same time. If you practice the steps above in order, your pet
			will eventually lean what the cue means.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Final tips">
		<ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
			<li>
				After you add the cue, don’t reward the behavior anymore unless you first give the cue.
			</li>
			<li>
				Practice a new behavior in many different places so that your pet learns how to do it
				everywhere. Start in calm, quiet environments and slowly work up to more distracting
				locations.
			</li>
			<li>
				After you’ve practiced a new behavior in several different places and your pet reliably
				responds to your cue, you can begin to cut back on rewards for that behavior. Reward only
				the best responses (like the highest paw raise), or reward the behavior under the most
				difficult or distracting conditions. You can also reward just because you haven’t rewarded
				that behavior in a little while. Start using a variety of rewards, like your pet’s dinner,
				access to outdoors, games, toys, access to playmates - anything your pet loves can be used
				as a reward!
			</li>
			<li>
				Clicker training should be enjoyable for both trainer and trainee. Don’t train if you’re in
				a bad mood, distracted, or don’t have time to finish a session. Keep sessions short and
				upbeat. You’ll be amazed what a terrific student your pet is.
			</li>

				private lessons.
