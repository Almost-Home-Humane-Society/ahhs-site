		<p>
			We know that you have just committed to a new family member, and this can be stressful and
			exciting for all involved. Including your new dog! When bringing your dog home for the first
			time, keep in mind that he or she has probably been through a lot in the last few days. He may
			have have been lost on the streets for some time before coming to a shelter. He may have even
			been given up by her previous owner. Coming in to a new family can be very overwhelming for a
			dog.

			This will ensure there are no surprises and help your new dog adjust more quickly. Try to work
			the adoption into your schedule so you have a few days to be at home with your new dog to help
			her adjust while you get to know her. Your first day with your new dog should be spent
			allowing her to get used to her new home. Everything he encounters will be new and possibly
			stressful for her, so it is important to allow her to adjust at her own pace. It could take
			two days for her to be her normal, or it could take two months. There is no set time limit on
			this adjustment period because every dog is different.

		<p>
			It is best to give your new pup some time to adjust to you and your family before taking her
			to new places. As much fun as it is to pick out toys and supplies with your new friend, it can
			be overwhelming for her to be in a busy store with so many people and smells.

			It is important that training begins early, no matter how old your new companion is.
			Socializing puppies is crucial to their development and will help you have. well-rounded pup
			as an adult. For all dogs, we recommend clicker training. This is great form of positive
			reinforcement trainings that can help teach your dog manners, help a fearful dog become more
			confident, and can even be a fantastic stress reliever for your dog.
