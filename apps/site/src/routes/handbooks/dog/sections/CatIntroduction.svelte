<Section title="Cat to dog introductions">
	<p>
		You’ll need to be even more careful when introducing a dog and cat the one another. A dog can
		seriously injure and even kill a cat very easily, even if they’re only playing! Some dogs have
		such a high prey drive that they should never be left alone with a cat. Dogs usually want to
		chase and play with cats, and cats usually become afraid and defensive. To promote a good
		transition into the home, practice these steps:
	</p>
	<SubSection title="Practice obedience">
		<p>
			If your dog doesn’t already know the commands “sit,” “down,” “come,” and “stay,” begin working
			on them right away. Small pieces of food will increase your dog’s motivation to perform, which
			will be necessary in the presence of a strong distraction (such as a new cat!). Even if your
			dog already knows these commands, works to reinforce these commands.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Set up controlled meetings">
		<p>
			Allow your new dog and your resident cat to get to know each other’s scent. Have them eat on
			opposite sides of a door and expose them to items that may smell like each other (bedding,
			etc.). After they have become comfortable eating on opposite sides of the door and have been
			exposed to each other’s scents, you can attempt a face-to-face introduction in a controlled
			manner. Put your dog’s leash on and have her either sit or lie down and stay for treats. Have
			a second person offer your cat some special pieces of food. At first, the cat and the dog
			should be on opposite sides of the room. Many short visits are better than a few long visits.
			Don’t drag out the visit so long that the dog becomes uncontrollable. Repeat this tea several
			times until both the cat and dog are tolerating each other’s presence without fear,
			aggression, or other undesirable behavior.

	<SubSection title="Let your cat go">
		<p>
			Next, allow your cat some freedom to explore your dog at her own pace, with the dog still
			on-leash and in a “down-stay.” Meanwhile, keep giving your dog treats and praise for her calm
			behavior. If your dog gets up from her “stay” position, he or she would be re-positioned with
			a treat lure and praised and rewarded for obeying the “stay” command. If your cat runs away or
			becomes aggressive, you’re progressing too fast. Go back to the previous introduction steps.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Use positive reinforcement">
		<p>
			Although your dog must be taught that chasing or being rough with your cat is unacceptable
			behavior, he must also be taught what is appropriate and be rewarded for those behaviors, such
			as sitting, coming when called, or lying down for a treat. If your dog is always punished when
			your cat is around and never has “good things” happen in the cat’s presence, your dog may
			redirect aggression toward the cat.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Directly supervise all interactions">
		<p>
			You may want to keep your dog at your side and on-leash whenever your cat is free in the house
			during the introduction process. Be sure that your cat has an escape route and a place to
			hide. Until you’re certain the cat will be safe, be sure to keep two separated when you aren’t
			home.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Kittens and puppies">
		<p>
			Because they are so much smaller, kittens are in more danger of being injured or killed by a
			young energetic dog or by a predatory dog. A kitten will need to be kept separate from an
			especially energetic dog until she is fully grown. Even after the cat is fully grown, she may
			not be able to be safely left alone with the dog. Usually, a well-socialized cat will be able
			to keep a puppy in her place, but some cats don’t have enough confidence to do this. If you
			have an especially shy cat, you might need to keep them separated from your puppy until he
			matures enough to have more self- control.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="When to get help">
		<p>
			If introductions don’t go smoothly, seek professional advice immediately from a certified
			animal behavior specialist. Animals can be severely injured in fights, and the longer the
			problem continues, the harder it is to resolve. Punishment won’t work and can actually make
			things worse. Luckily, most conflicts between pets in the same family can be resolved with
			professional guidance.
