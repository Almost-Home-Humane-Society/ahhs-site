<Section title="Understanding your talkative cat">

	<p></p>
	<SubSection title="Medical reasons">
		<p>
			If your cat’s behavior changes suddenly, the first thing you should do is take her to your
			veterinarian for a thorough health examination. Cats often hide symptoms of illness until
			they’re seriously ill; any change in behavior may be an easy indication of a medical problem.
			A new vocalizing behavior, in particular, may indicate physical discomfort stemming from an
			urgent need for medical attention. A normally vocal cat who stops talking is also in need of a
			medical check up.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Breed tendency">
		<p>
			Asian breeds, such as the Siamese, are known to be very vocal. If your cat has a pointed face
			and a long, lean body, chances are she has some Asian heritage, so “talking” may be a part of
			her character. If your cat’s chatter bothers you, then avoid giving her any attention when she
			is vocal because this will only encourage the vocal behavior. Instead, give her attention when
			she is quiet.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Attention-seeking behavior">
		<p>
			Some cats '“talk” because they know they’ll get a reaction. People may talk back, put out some
			food, put up and pick up the cat, or even pick the animal up and temporarily “lock” her in
			another room. All of these responses will encourage an attention-seeking cat. To discourage
			this behavior, simply ignore your cat when she does this, and when she is quiet, pour on the
			love, feed her, or give her some treats. This will teach your cat which behaviors you would
			like to continue.

	<SubSection title="Your cat wants to go outside">
		<p>
			If your cat was previously an outdoor cat and you plan to keep her safely inside, then good
			for you! The following are some suggestions to help make the transition easier on both you:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>
				Spay or Neuter Your Cat: Spaying or neutering will rid your cat of those hormonal urges to
				go out and seek a mate. This will result in a calmer, friendlier cat.
			</li>
			<li>
				Create a play schedule: schedule play times during the times your at would normally be
				outside. This will distract her from her normal routine and establish another, safer
				routine.
			</li>
			<li>
				Provide a Window Seat: Be sure your cat has a view of the outdoors and a sunny place to lie.
				Cats like to watch birds, so putting a bird feeder outside a window is likely to make the
				window a favorite spot for your cat.
			</li>
			<li>
				Run a Scavenger Hunt: Give your cat a game to play by hiding bits of dry food around the
				house. Hide the food in paper bags, boxes, and behind open doors. This will give her
				exercise and keep her busy so she doesn’t think of going outside. This is especially good to
				do right before the family leaves the house for the day.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pay Attention: try to give your cat extra love and attention during this difficult
				transition.
			</li>
			<li>
				Try an Aversive: If your cat still won’t give up meowing by the door, try an “aversive.” For
				example, leave a strong citrus scent by the door to help make the area undesirable to your
				cat. Totally ignore her vocalizations. Whenever she is quiet, give her a food treat and
				encourage her to play or cuddle.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Grief">
		<p>
			After the death or departure of a person or animal in your cat’s life, she may vocalize to
			express her grief. This can be a normal part o the grieving process. The best thing you can do
			for her is keep her schedule the same (or as close to it as possible) and spend some extra
			time cuddling and playing with her. With time, this problem should take care of itself. If
			your cat does not return to her normal self, consult your veterinarian.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Transition">
		<p>
			If your cat is new to your home or has just gone through a change - such as a person or other
			animal moving into or out of the home - and she has just started her talkative behavior, be
			patient. This may be happening due to the transition and will stop on its own if the behavior
			is not encouraged. Remember, even scolding can be perceived by your cat as attention, and thus
			encourage the behavior.
