<Section title="Introducing your cat to the litter box">
	<p>
		Most of us know cats are finicky eaters, but they can also be pretty picky when it comes to the
		other end of the digestive process - making use of a litter box. Fortunately, the following
		suggestions should keep your cat from “thinking outside the box.”
	</p>
	<SubSection title="Location, location, location">
		<p>
			Most people are inclined to place the litter box in an out-of-the-way spot to minimize odor
			and prevent cat litter from being tracked throughout the house. But if the litter box ends up
			in the basement - next to an appliance or on a cold cement floor - your cat may be less than
			pleased for a number of reasons.
		</p>
		<p>
			A kitten or an older cat may not be able to get down a long flight of stairs in time to get to
			the litter box. If the litter box is located in an area that he or she seldom frequents, they
			may not even remember where it is, especially during the first few weeks he or she is welcomed
			in to your home. If a furnace, washing machine, or dryer suddenly comes on and startles your
			cat while using the litter box, that may be the last time the cat risks such a frightening
			experience. And if your cat likes to scratch the surface surrounding the litter box (which
			some cats do), she may find a cold cement floor unappealing.
		</p>
		<p>
			So you may have to compromise. The litter box should be kept in a spot that affords your cat
			some privacy yet is also conveniently located. If you place the litter box in a closet or a
			bathroom, be sure the door is wedged open form both sides to prevent the cat from being
			trapped inside or locked out. Depending on the location, you might consider cutting a hole in
			the closet door and adding a pet door.
		</p>

	<SubSection title="Pick of the litter">
		<p>
			Research has shown that most cats prefer fine-grained litters, presumably because they have a
			softer feel. The new scoop able (clumping) litters usually have finer grains than the typical
			clay litter and are very popular. But high quality, dust-free, clay litters are relatively
			small-grained and may be perfectly acceptable to your cat.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you suspect your cat has spent part of his or her life outdoors and is likely to eliminate
			in your houseplants, try mixing some potting soil with your regular litter; pellet-type
			litters or those made from citrus peels are not recommended. once you find litter your cat
			likes, stick with it. Buying the least expensive litter or the brand that’s on sale any given
			week could result in your cat not using the litter box.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many cats are put off by the odor of scented or deodorant litters. For the same reason, it’s
			not a good idea to place a room deodorizer or air freshener near the litter box. A thin layer
			of baking soda placed on the bottom of the box will help absorb odors without repelling your
			cat, and odors shouldn’t really be a problem if you keep the litter box clean. If you find the
			litter box for offensive, your cat probably finds that it even more offensive and won’t want
			to eliminate there.
