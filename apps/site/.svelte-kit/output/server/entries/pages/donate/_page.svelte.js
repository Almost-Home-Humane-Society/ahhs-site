				made a difference by supporting our work with your valuable time, funds pet supply
				donations. As part of your Estate Planning, you can help ensure that future generations have
				access to the same animal welfare services. Your legacy gift helps us to ensure that pets
				will be a valued part of our community for years to come. The support you are currently
				providing for our communities homeless and disadvantaged pets can continue for perpetuity.
				For example, if you typically make an annual gift of $250 to AHHS, by making a $5,000 estate
				gift, the interest generated on that principal would continue to provide $250 every year
				indefinitely to help the Almost Home care for the pets that need us the most.</p> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-3 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red">It's Not Difficult to Give a Legacy Gift</h4> <p>A beneficiary designation is the simplest way to make a legacy gift to Almost Home Humane
					Society. When you complete your beneficiary designation form, just name “Almost Home
					Humane Society, Inc.” as a full or partial beneficiary and provide our tax identification
					number (35-0984028). In addition, these gifts bypass probate and go directly to all
					beneficiaries.</p> <p>Here are some common designation options:</p> <p>Retirement plans[e.g., traditional IRA, Keogh, 401(k)]: Including Almost Home as a
					beneficiary enables you to avoid substantial income taxes that would have been due if a
					retirement plan were left to non-spousal heirs. It is strongly advised that you name
					“‘Almost Home Humane Society” as a beneficiary of a retirement plan through your
					designation form and not through your will, which may jeopardize tax benefits.</p> <p>Savings accounts: Designating AHHS as a beneficiary of a savings account is simple and
					allows full use of savings during your life.</p> <p>The following is suggested language for unrestricted bequests to be used for the greatest
					current need of the Humane Society:</p> <p>I give to Almost Home Humane Society, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation organized under
					the laws of the state of Indiana and located in Lafayette, Indiana, ___percent (___%) of
					my estate OR (the sum of $______) OR (all my right, title and interest in the described
					property: ________________) OR (all rest, residue and remainder of my estate) to be used
					in such manner as the board of directors of said corporation shall, in its sole
					discretion, determine.</p> <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red">Gifts via Life Insurance Policies</h4> <p>One way to “gift” life insurance is to designate your charity of choice as the
					beneficiary. You will retain ownership of the policy, keeping access to the policy’s cash
					value. You will still be allowed to change your beneficiary at a later time, if you
					choose.</p> <p>You can also transfer ownership, assigning your charity of choice as BOTH owner and
					beneficiary. This method will NOT allow you to change your beneficiary or have access to
					the cash value of the policy, but it will provide tax benefits. If your charity of choice
					is a 501-c-3 (like AHHS) then the premiums you pay on the policy should be tax
					deductible.Similar benefits also apply to annuities.</p> <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red">Gifts of Securities are also Accepted</h4> <p>If you sell appreciated securities, you could lose up to 25% of your appreciation to
					taxes. But when you donate a gift of stock or securities to the Humane Society, you avoid
					capital-gains taxes thus preserving the full value of your gift. Your tax adviser can help
					you. There can be significant tax advantages for you or your family in exploring planned
					giving options, including gifts of stocks and bonds, charitable gift annuities, trusts,
					and estate gifts. To learn more about making a planned gift to Almost Home, contact our
					Development Department at (765) 474-5222.</p> <ul class="list-none"><li>Legal Name: Almost Home Humane Society, Inc</li> <li>Street Address: 1705 S. 2nd St., Lafayette, IN 47905</li> <li>EIN: 35-0984028</li></ul></div></section> <section class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-3"><h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">Funding</h3> <p>Almost Home is a private non-profit organization and not affiliated with any national or

				These contracts provide approximately 31% of our total budget. The remainder of the funds
