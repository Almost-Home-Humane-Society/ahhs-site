				treats.</li> <li>If at any time during this process your cat shows fearful behavior, you’ve proceeded too

					or her either sit or lie down and stay for treats. Have a second person offer your cat
					some special pieces of food. At first, the cat and the dog should be on opposite side of
					the room. Lots of short visits are better than a few long visits. Don’t drag out the visit

		it may be time to draw a line in the sand. Many cats prefer eliminating on a loose, grainy
		substance, which is why they quickly learn to use a litter box. But when their preferences
		include the laundry basket, the bed, or the Persian rug, yo may find yourself with a difficult
		problem. By taking a closer look at your cat’s environment, you should be able to identify
		factors that have contributed to the litter box problem and make changes that encourage your cat
		to head for the litter box once again.</p> <p>A common reason why cats don’t use the litter box is an aversion to the box, such as dislike of
		a covered box or dissatisfaction with the depth of the litter. Two other common reasons you cat
		may avoid the litter box are a preference for a particular type of litter not provided in the
		box or a preference for a particular location where there is no box.</p> <p>Sometimes the problem is a combination of all three factors. To get the answer, you’ll need to
		do a little detective work - and remember, the original source of the problems may not be the
		reason its continuing. For example, your cat may have stopped using the litter box because of a
		urinary tract infection, and then developed a surface preference for carpet and a location
		preference for the bedroom closet. If that’s the case, you’ll need to address all three of these
		factors to resolve the problem.</p> <p>Cat’s don’t stop using their litter boxes because they are upset at their human caregivers and
		determined to get revenge for something that offended or angered them. Because humans act for
		these reasons, it’s easy for us to assume that our pets do as well. But animals don’t act out of
		spite or revenge, so it won’t help to punish your cat or give her special privileges in the hope
		that she’ll started using the litter box again.</p> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!>`,1);function ie(m){v(m,{title:"Solving litter box problems",children:(y,g)=>{var c=re(),d=a(b(c),8);n(d,{title:"Medical problems",children:(e,i)=>{var r=V();t(e,r)}});var p=a(d,2);n(p,{title:"Cleaning soiled areas",children:(e,i)=>{var r=X();t(e,r)}});var h=a(p,2);n(h,{title:"Aversion to the litter box",children:(e,i)=>{var r=ee();f(4),t(e,r)}});var u=a(h,2);n(u,{title:"Surface preferences",children:(e,i)=>{var r=te();f(4),t(e,r)}});var s=a(u,2);n(s,{title:"Location preferences",children:(e,i)=>{var r=oe();f(4),t(e,r)}});var l=a(s,2);n(l,{title:"Everyone makes mistakes",children:(e,i)=>{var r=ae();f(2),t(e,r)}}),t(y,c)}})}var ne=o(`<p>Positive reinforcement may include food treats, praise, petting, or a favorite toy or game.
			When your pet is first learning a new behavior, such as clawing the scratching post instead of
			your couch, he or she should be rewarded every time you catch him or her using the scratching
			post. You may even help shape his or hers behavior of using the scratching post by spraying it
			with catnip (if she reacts positively to catnip) or enticing him or her with a toy that you
			dangle on the post. Taking your cat over to the scratching post, positioning their paws on the
			post, and raking them along the post to show him or her what they are supposed to do will
			likely have the opposite effect of encouraging him or her to use the post. She may interpret
			your actions as frightening and uncomfortable. It’s important to look at the world from his or
			hers point of view.</p> <p>Once your cat reliably offers the desired behavior, you may reward him or her with treats
			intermittently, for example, three our of every four times he or she does the behavior. Then,
			over time, reward him or her about half the time, then about a third of the time, and so on,
			until you’re only rewarding occasionally with a treat. Continue to praise every time. Your cat
			will learn that if he or she keeps offering desired behaviors, eventually he or she will get
			what they want - your praise and an occasional treat. You won’t be forever bound to carry a
			pocket full of goodies, but it’s fun to surprise your cat from time to time.</p>`,1),se=o(`<p>Punishment can be verbal, postural or physical and is meant to make your pet immediately
			associate something unpleasant when he or she doesn’t something you don’t want them to do. The
			punishment makes it less likely that they behavior will occur again. To be effective,
			punishment must be delivered while your pet is engaged in the undesirable behavior - in other
			words, “caught in the act”. If the punishment is delivered too late, even seconds later, your
			pet will not associate the punishment with the undesired behavior. The punishment will seem
			unpredictable to your pet.</p> <p>Remember, cats do not act our of spite or revenge, and they don’t have a moral sense of right
			and wrong. Never use physical punishment that involves discomfort or pain as this may cause
			him or her to bite, defend him or herself or resort to other undesirable behaviors. Holding
			your cat’s neck skin and shaking him or her may result in a frightened cat whom scratches or
			bites to defend themself. Punishment might be associated with other stimuli, including people,
			which are present at the time the punishment occurs. For example, a cat this is punished for
			getting too close to a new baby may become fearful or, or aggressive toward, that baby - or
			toward other babies. That’s why physical punishment is not only bad for your cat; it’s also
			bad for you and others.</p> <p>Punishment delivered by you may erode your cat’s trust and frighten him or her. That’s why
			punishment is most effective when it does not come directly from you. For example, if your cat
			enjoys searching the couch, you may apply special double-sided tape to those surfaces. Cats
			rarely like tacky paws. Your cat will perceive the couch, instead of you, as delivering the
			punishment. In this way, too, your cat is more likely to avoid the undesirable behavior when
			you’re not around. However, it is critical that while discouraging undesirable behaviors, you
			help your cat understand what you want him or her to do and provide appropriate outlets for
			normal cat behaviors.</p>`,1),le=o(`<p>We all like to be praised rather than punished. The same is true for your cat, and that’s the

		pleasant or rewarding immediately after he or she does something you want him or her to do.

		future, it is one of your most powerful tools for shaping or changing your cat’s behavior. It’s
		more effective to teach your pet what he or she should do than try to teach him or her what they
		shouldn’t.</p> <p>Correct timing is essential when sign positive reinforcement. The reward must occur immediately
		within seconds or your cat may not associate it with the proper action. For example, when your
		cat uses her scratching post, you can throw a piece of dry cat food for him or her to chase as a
		reward. Many cats enjoy chasing (hunting) their food and it’s good exercise too. but if you
		throw the food when he or she has stopped scratching the post and is walking toward you, he or

				window a favorite spot for your cat.</li> <li>Run a Scavenger Hunt: Give your cat a game to play by hiding bits of dry food around the

				exercise and keep her busy so she doesn’t think of going outside. This is especially good to
				do right before the family leaves the house for the day.</li> <li>Pay Attention: try to give your cat extra love and attention during this difficult
				transition.</li> <li>Try an Aversive: If your cat still won’t give up meowing by the door, try an “aversive.” For
