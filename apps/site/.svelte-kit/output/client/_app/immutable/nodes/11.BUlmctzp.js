						accurate list of those looking for specific pets. The best way to find a specific type

						abundance of species and breeds frequently!</p></div> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-1 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red-200">How do you know the breeds of each dog?</h4> <p class="px-2 md:px-4 lg:px-8">Almost Home believes that every dog is an individual, though genetics play a role!
						Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of our dogs we can only
						guess their predominant breed or mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by
						considering each dog’s individual personality instead of relying on a breed label.</p></div> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-1 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red-200">What happens if more than one family is interested in the same pet?</h4> <p class="px-2 md:px-4 lg:px-8">AHHS operates on a best-fit, first-come basis. The first home that fits the dogs needs
						will be approved for adoption. If you are declined for a dog, it does not mean you are
						not approved to adopt any dog. It means that there was a better fit, particularly for
						that individual dog's needs. We recommend checking out our other available dogs to see
						if a different one could be your perfect partner.</p></div> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-1 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red-200">What if I need to return or re-home my adopted pet?</h4> <p class="px-2 md:px-4 lg:px-8">If you are no longer able to care for your adopted pet, AHHS will accept it back into

						it. If the pet is not reclaimed within the five day period, it will be evaluated
						behaviorally and medically for adoption. Once it has been evaluated it will be placed up
						for adoption, under the same protocols as all other animals at AHHS. Almost Home will
						not release the exact date a pet may become available, so please check back frequently
						if you are interested in adopting.</p></div> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-1 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red-200">What happens if my new pet becomes ill after adoption?</h4> <p class="px-2 md:px-4 lg:px-8">AHHS does its best to ensure that all pets are healthy at the time of adoption. However,
						the move to a new household is stressful and sometimes illness does occur. Any illnesses
						after adoption are the responsibility of the adopter to treat. AHHS strongly encourages
						using the complimentary vet exam within 7 days of adoption and participating in the
						30-day trial of insurance.</p></div> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-1 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red-200">What happens if I need to surrender my pet?</h4> <p class="px-2 md:px-4 lg:px-8">AHHS is accepting pet surrenders as quickly as space is allowing! Please complete the
						surrender application under "Resources - Surrender a Pet". AHHS will then evaluate our
						ability to intake the pet with available resources and contact you to schedule the
						surrender appointment. As a no-kill facility, surrendered pets may stay with us as long
						as they need to find a home. This requires us to charge a small surrender fee to help

All
						of our dogs and cats are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, up to date on
						flea/tick and heartworm preventative, dewormed, and treated for any illnesses or
						injuries prior to adoption. Additionally, no animals have time-limits at our facility.
						The cost to prepare an animal for adoption is much higher than the adoption fee. To
						ensure we can provide this service to other animals in need, the adoption fee helps
						offset some of our care cost.</p></div> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-1 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red-200">How does AHHS determine the age and breed of adoptable pets?</h4> <p class="px-2 md:px-4 lg:px-8">Some pets arrive to AHHS as stray transfers with little to no history; others are
						surrenders. Age is estimated based upon the amount of tartar on teeth as well as the
						physical condition of the pet. Breed is an estimation based upon the size, body shape,
						and coloration. AHHS and our medical team take all traits into account to make our best
						estimate on age and breed, though we cannot guarantee either.</p></div> <div class="flex flex-col basis-full gap-1 px-4"><h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red-200">Does AHHS accept owner-surrendered pets?</h4> <p class="px-2 md:px-4 lg:px-8">Almost Home Humane Society is classified as a limited-admission shelter.
