<Section title="Introducing your new dog to your home">
	<p>
		Animals that live in groups (like dogs) establish relationship through which the individuals
		involved interact and live together. The roles that the individuals play within the relationship
		can change with each new day or situation. These relationship also take time to build, so proper
		introductions are important to help the dogs adjust to one another and start to build their
		relationship.
	</p>
	<SubSection title="Introduce one dog at a time">
		<p>
			If you have more than one resident dog in your household, it may be best to introduce the
			resident dogs to the new dog one at a time. Two or more resident dogs may have a tendency to
			“gang up” on the newcomer.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Choose a neutral location">
		<p>
			Introduce the dogs in a natural location so that your resident dog is less likely to view the
			newcomer as an intruder. Each dog should be handled by a separate person. With both dogs on a
			leash, take them to an area that neither dog is familiar with (such as a park) where you can
			go for a walk together. Take the dogs for a walk starting out approximately 10-15 feet apart,
			slowly allowing the dogs to get closer together. Do not allow them to meet while the handlers
			are holding the leashes. This can cause defensive behavior that is not true to the dog’s
			natural behavior. Give simple commands and offer food rewards often throughout the walk,
			congratulating them on walking near each other without any issues.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Be aware of body postures">
		<p>
			One body posture that indicates things are going well is the “play bow.” One dog will crouch
			with her front legs on the ground and her hind end in the air. This is an invitation to play
			that usually elicits friendly behavior from the other dog. Other appropriate investigative
			behaviors might include sniffing the air in the direction of the other dog, looking at or
			walking toward the other dog with a tail that is low and loose and wagging in a large arch.
			Watch carefully for body postures, interrupt the interaction immediately by calmly and
			positively getting each dog interested in something else. For example, both handlers can walk
			backwards while calling their dogs to them, have them sit or lie down, and reward each with a
			treat, then resume your walk. Raised hackles, or hair on standing up on the back of the dog’s
			neck, may indicate that the dog is concerned and needs more space from the other dog and time
			to acclimate. It is not necessarily a concern (raised hackles is completely involuntary for a
			dog) but it is something to notice in conjunction with possible other body language. It is
			best to walk with the dogs on a loose or soft leash so that there is no pressure or tension on
			the leash from the handler. Pressure or tension on the leash can leash to a change in the
			dog’s body language that can be misinterpreted by the other dog.
		</p>
		<p>See the section “Walking with Your Dog” for more information on loose leash walking.</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Taking the dogs home">
		<p>
			When the dogs seem to be tolerating each other without fearful or aggressive responses and the
			investigative greeting behaviors have tapered off, you can take them home to your backyard or
			to a friend’s neutral backyard. Bring both dogs into the yard and (when they are ignoring each
			other) drop the leashes. Allow the dogs to investigate the yard and each other without
			interference from the handlers on the ends of the leashes. Don’t force any interaction between
			the dogs. If the dogs ignore each other at first, or if one dog seems reluctant to interact
			with the other, that’s okay. It is appropriate for one dog to tell the other that they are
			moving too quickly or coming on too strong. This can be done with a growl, a bark, a lip curl,
			or even snapping in the air. Consider allowing them to communicate with each other. It becomes
			inappropriate or problematic if it is a prolonged correction from he dog after the corrected
			dog moved away or if the corrected dog doesn’t back off. Give both dogs time to get
			comfortable. They’ll interact when they’re ready.
		</p>
		<p>
			Carefully watch the body language as described above. Hackles (the raised hair along a dog’s
			back) are an involuntary response to excitement, arousal, fear, anxiety, or any other number
			of emotions. Hackles alone can’t tell you whether or not a dog is concerned about the other
			and they may calm over time. Keep an eye our for other concerning body postures coupled with
			hackles before intervening. If you are concerned about the body language, the handlers can
			pick up the ends of the leashes and move in opposite directions to move the dogs away from
			each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you are comfortable that the dogs are doing well together outside the home, pick up the
			leashes and take the new dog into the house while the second person remains outside with the
			resident dog. Giving the new dog an opportunity to explore the home on her own can allow the
			dogs time to relax from the initial meeting as well as give the new dog a chance to get to
			know her new surroundings without the established dog interfering. You can also take this
			opportunity to remove any food, toys, bones, bedding, or other items that might trigger
			conflict between the dogs. Peek under the furniture and in between couch cushions for bones
			and toys hidden away. Giving the new dog the chance to enter the home first can often diffuse
			territorial issues. After the new dog has explored the home, bring the new dog into a large
			room, on leash, to prevent the dogs’ from having an initial meeting in the home in a narrow
			hallway or entryway and then bring the resident dog into the same room, on leash. When the
			dogs are not focused on each other, drop the leashes and allow both dogs to further
			investigate the room and each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be patient! Bringing a new dog home requires that everyone make some adjustments, especially
			your current pets. It will take time for your dogs to build a comfortable relationship.
		</p>

			<span class="italic"
				>Do not leave the dogs alone until you are confident they are getting along!</span
			> This means observing their behavior towards each other when the doorbell rings, when a squirrel
			is seen outside the window, and other such exciting circumstances. It is okay to crate your new
			dog when you cannot supervise, even if the resident dog is allowed to free roam. It is best to
			place the crated dog in a room behind a closed door away from the other dog so they cannot “talk”
			to each other through the crate door. Take your time to observe their interactions before choosing
			to leave them alone unsupervised. Consider getting breakaway collars for safety for crated dogs
			and when two dogs are playing to avoid accidents.

	<SubSection title="Introducing puppies to adult dogs">
		<p>
			Puppies usually pester adult dogs unmercifully. Before approximately the age of four months
			(or sometimes older) puppies may not recognize subtle body postures from adult dogs signaling
			that they’ve had enough. Well-socialized adult dogs with good temperaments may set limits with
			puppies with a growl or snarl, never hurting the puppy (the puppy may yelp out of surprise
			though). This communication is healthy and should be allowed. Adult dogs that aren’t well
			socialized, or that have a history of fighting with other dogs, may attempt to set limits with
			more aggressive behaviors (such as biting) that could harm the puppy. For this reason, a puppy
			shouldn’t be left alone with an adult dog. Crating the puppy when alone will keep everyone
			safe and benefit house training. Be sure to give the adult dog some quiet time away from the
			puppy, and perhaps some individual attention. When you help the adult dog have some space away
			from the puppy, the adult dog will likely be happier when it is time to see the puppy.

	<SubSection title="When to get help">
		<p>
			If the introduction of a new dog to a household doesn’t go smoothly, contact a profressional
			trainer immediately for help. Dogs can be severely injured in fights and the longer the
			problem continues, the harder it can be to resolve. Conflicts between dogs in the same family
			can often be resolved with professional help.

	<SubSection title="Additional tips for successful introduction">
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>
				Pick up all toys, chews, food bows, etc. These types of items can cause a rivalry. Once the
				dogs start to form a good relationship, these items can be reintroduced.
			</li>
			<li>Give each dog their own food/water bowl, bed, and toys.</li>
			<li>
				Separate the dogs while playing fetch until you determine the level of focus your dogs have
				towards the ball. The excitement of fetch can cause conflict in ball-focused dogs.
			</li>
			<li>Feed the dogs in completely separate areas and pick up bowls when they are done.</li>
			<li>Confine the dogs in separate areas whenever you’re away.</li>
