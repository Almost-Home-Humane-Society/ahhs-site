<Section title="Destructive scratching">
	<p>
		Although some people think a cat’s scratching behavior is a reflection of her distaste for a
		couch’s upholstery, a not-so-subtle hint to open the drapes, or a poorly conceived Zorro
		impersonation, the fact is that cats scratch objects in their environment for many perfectly
		normal reasons.
	</p>
	<SubSection title="Why do cats scratch?">
		<p>Cats scratch for many reasons, including:</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>To remove the dead outer layer of their claws.</li>
			<li>
				To mark their territory by leaving both a visual mark and a scent - they have scent glands
				on their paws.
			</li>
			<li>To stretch their bodies and flex their feet and claws.</li>
			<li>To work off energy</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Because scratching is normal behavior and one that cats are highly motivated to display, it’s
			unrealistic to try to prevent them from scratching. Instead, the goal in resolving scratching
			problems is to redirect the scratching onto acceptable objects.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Training your cat to scratch acceptable objects">
		<p>
			You must provide objects for scratching that are appealing, attractive and convenient from
			your cat’s point of view. Start by observing the physical features of the objects your cat is
			scratching. The answers to the following questions will help you understand your cat’s
			scratching preferences:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>
				Where are they located? Prominent objects, objects close to sleeping areas, and objects near
				the entrance to a room are often chosen.
			</li>
			<li>What texture do they have - are they soft or coarse?</li>
			<li>What shape fo they have - are they horizontal or vertical?</li>
			<li>How tall are they? At what height does your cat scratch?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Now, considering your cat’s demonstrated preferences, substitute similar objects for her to
			scratch (rope-wrapped posts, corrugated cardboard, or even a log). Place the acceptable
			object(s) near the inappropriate object(s) that she’s already using. Make sure the objects are
			stable and won’t fall over or move mourned when she uses them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cover the inappropriate objects with something you cat will find unappealing, such as
			double-sided sticky tape, aluminum foil, sheets of sandpaper, or a plastic carpet runner with
			the pointy side up. Or you may give the objects and aversive odor by a teaching cotton balls
			containing perfume, a muscle rub, or other safe yet unpleasant substances. Be careful with
			odors, though because you don’t want the nearby acceptable objects to also smell unpleasant.
		</p>
		<p>
			When your cat is consistently using the appropriate object, it can be moved very gradually (no
			more than 3 inches per day) to a location more suitable for you. It’s best, however, to keep
			the appropriate scratching objects as close to your cat’s preferred scratching locations as
			possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don't remove the unappealing coverings or orders from the inappropriate objects until your cat
			is consistently using the appropriate objects in their permanent locations for several weeks,
			or even a month. They should then be removed gradually, not all at once.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Should I punish by cat for scratching?">
		<p>
			NO! Punishment is effective only if you cat your cat in the act of scratching unacceptable
			objects and have provided her with acceptable scratching objects. Punishment after the face
			won’t change the behavior, may cause her to be afraid of your or the environment, and may
			elicit defensive aggression. used by itself, punishment won’t resolve scratching problems
			because it doesn’t teach your cat where to scratch instead. If you do catch your cat in the
			act of scratching inappropriate objects, punish her in a way that prevents her from
			associating the punishment with you. Try make in a loud noise (using a whistle, shaking a soda
			can filled with rocks or slapping the wall) or using a water-filled squirt bottle. If you use
			other, more interactive techniques, she’ll learn to refrain from scratching in your presence
			but will continue to scratch when you’re not around.
		</p>

	<SubSection title="How do I trim my cat's claws?">
		<p>
			To help keep them sharp, cats keep their claws retracted until they’re needed. As the claws
			grow too long and become curved, they can’t be retracted completely. You should clip off the
			sharp tips of your cat’s claws on her front feet every two weeks or so. Clipping your cat’s
			claws will also help prevent them from becoming snagged in the carpets and fabrics, not to
			mention your skin!
		</p>
		<p>
			Before trimming your cat’s claws, help her get accustomed to having her paws handled and
			squeezed. You can do this by gently petting her legs and paws while giving her a treat. This
			will help to make it a more pleasant experience. Gradually increase the pressure so that
			petting becomes gentle squeezing, and you’ll need to do this to extend the claw. Continue with
			the treats until your cat tolerates this kind of touching and restraint. It may take a little
			longer if she’s not used to having her legs or paws handled.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apply a small amount of pressure to her paw with your thumb on top of her paw and your index
			finger underneath until a claw is extended. You should be able to see the pink or “quick,”
			which is a small blood vessel. Don’t cut into this pink portion as it will bleed and be
			painful for your cat. If you cut off just the sharp tup of the claw, the “hook,” it will dull
			the claw and prevent extensive damage to household objects and to your skin.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are several types of claw trimmers designed especially for pets. These are better than
			your own nail clipper because they won’t crush the claw. Until you and your cat have become
			accustomed to the routine, one claw or foot a day is enough of a challenge. Don’t push to do
			all of them at once, or you’ll both have only negative memories o claw clippers!
		</p>

	<SubSection title="Should I declaw my cat?">
		<p>
			Declawing is a procedure whereby a veterinarian amputates the end digit and claw of a cat’s
			paws - similar in scope to cutting off a person’s finger at the last joint. The Humane Society
			of the United States opposes declawing when done solely for the convenience of the owner.
			Scratching is a natural behavior for cats and can be directed to appropriate items. Declawing
			can also lead to litter box or aggression problems.
