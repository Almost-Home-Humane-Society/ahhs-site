<Section title="Solving litter box problems">
	<p>
		If you’re having hard time persuading your cat to head for the litter box when it’s appropriate,
		it may be time to draw a line in the sand. Many cats prefer eliminating on a loose, grainy
		substance, which is why they quickly learn to use a litter box. But when their preferences
		include the laundry basket, the bed, or the Persian rug, yo may find yourself with a difficult
		problem. By taking a closer look at your cat’s environment, you should be able to identify
		factors that have contributed to the litter box problem and make changes that encourage your cat
		to head for the litter box once again.
	</p>
	<p>
		A common reason why cats don’t use the litter box is an aversion to the box, such as dislike of
		a covered box or dissatisfaction with the depth of the litter. Two other common reasons you cat
		may avoid the litter box are a preference for a particular type of litter not provided in the
		box or a preference for a particular location where there is no box.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sometimes the problem is a combination of all three factors. To get the answer, you’ll need to
		do a little detective work - and remember, the original source of the problems may not be the
		reason its continuing. For example, your cat may have stopped using the litter box because of a
		urinary tract infection, and then developed a surface preference for carpet and a location
		preference for the bedroom closet. If that’s the case, you’ll need to address all three of these
		factors to resolve the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cat’s don’t stop using their litter boxes because they are upset at their human caregivers and
		determined to get revenge for something that offended or angered them. Because humans act for
		these reasons, it’s easy for us to assume that our pets do as well. But animals don’t act out of
		spite or revenge, so it won’t help to punish your cat or give her special privileges in the hope
		that she’ll started using the litter box again.

	<SubSection title="Medical problems">
		<p>
			It’s common for cats with medical problems to begin eliminating outside of their litter boxes.
			For example, a urinary tract infection or crystals in the urine can make urination very
			painful - and both are serious conditions that require medical attention. Cats often associate
			this pain with the litter box and begin to avoid it. So if your cat has a house-soiling
			problem, check with your veterinarian first to rule out any medical problems as a cause of the
			behavior. Cats don’t always act sick even when they are, and only a trip to the veterinarian
			for a thorough physical examination can rule out a medical problem.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Cleaning soiled areas">
		<p>
			Because animals are highly motivated to continue soiling an area that smells like urine or
			feces - and because cat’s sense of smell is so much stronger than humans’ - it’s important to
			thoroughly and properly clean the soiled areas.
		</p>

	<SubSection title="Aversion to the litter box">
		<p>Your cat may have decided that the litter box is an unpleasant place to eliminate if:</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>The box is nor clean enough for him/her.</li>
			<li>
				She has experience painful urination or defecation in the box due to a medical problem.
			</li>
			<li>She has been startled by a noise while using the box.</li>
			<li>
				She has been ambushed while in the box either by another cat, a child, a dog, or by you, if
				you were attempting to catch her for some reason.
			</li>
			<li>
				She associates the box with punishment (for example, someone punished her for eliminating
				outside the box, then placed her in the box).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
			<h5 class="text-base font-bold">What you can do</h5>
			<p>
				Keep the litter box extremely clean. Scoop at least once a day and change the litter
				completely every four to five days. If you use scoop able litter, you may not need to change
				the litter as frequently, depending on the number of cats in the household, the size of the
				cats, and the number of litter boxes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you can smell ht box, then you can be pretty sure it’s offensive to your cat as well. Add
				a new box in a different location and use a different type of litter in the new box. Because
				your cat has decided that her old litter box is unpleasant, you’ll want to make the new one
				different enough that she doesn’t simply apply the old, negative associations to the new
				box.
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure that the litter box isn’t near an appliance (such as a furnace) that makes noise
				or in an area of the home that your cat doesn’t frequent.
			</p>
			<p>
				If ambushing is a problem, create more than one exit from the litter box, so that if the
				“ambusher” is waiting by one area, your cat always has an escape route.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have multiple cats, provide one litter box for each cat, plus one extra box in a
				different location.
			</p>
		</div>

	<SubSection title="Surface preferences">
		<p>
			All animals develop preferences for a particular surface on which they like to eliminate.
			These preferences may be established early in life, but they may also change overnight for
			reasons that we don’t always understand. Your cat may have a surface preference if:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>
				He or she consistently eliminates on a particular texture for example, soft-textured
				surfaces such as carpeting, bedding, or clothing, or slick-textured surfaces such as tile,
				cement, bathtubs, or sinks.
			</li>
			<li>
				He or she frequently scratches on this same texture after elimination, even if she
				eliminates in the litter box.
			</li>
			<li>
				He or she is or was previously an outdoor cat and prefers to eliminate on grass or soil.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
			<h5 class="text-base font-bold">What you can do</h5>
			<p>
				If you recently changed the type of brand of your cat’s litter, go back to providing the
				litter that your cat had been suing. If your cat is eliminating on soft surfaces, try using
				a high-quality scoop-able litter.
			</p>
			<p>
				If your cat is eliminating on slick, smoother surfaces, try putting a very thin layer of
				litter at one end of the box, leaving the other end bare, and put the box on a hard floor.
			</p>
			<p>If your cat has a history of being outdoors, add some soil or sod to the litter box.</p>
			<p>
				To discourage your cat from using a certain area, cover the area with an upside-down carpet
				runner or aluminum foil or place citrus-scented cotton balls over the area.
			</p>
		</div>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Location preferences">
		<p>Your cat may have a location preference if:</p>
		<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
			<li>
				He or she always eliminates in quiet, protected places, such as under a desk, beneath a
				staircase, or in a closet.
			</li>
			<li>
				He or she eliminates in an area where the litter box was previously kept or where there are
				urine odors.
			</li>
			<li>She eliminates on a different level of the home from where the litter box is located.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
			<h5 class="text-base font-bold">What you can do</h5>
			<p>
				Put at least one litter box on every level of your home. (Remember, a properly cleaned
				litter box does not smell).
			</p>
			<p>
				To make the area where he or she has been eliminating less appealing to your cat, cover the
				area with an upside-down carpet runner or aluminum foil, place citrus-scented cotton balls
				over the area, or place water bowls in the area (because cats often don’t like to eliminate
				near where they eat or drink), or put a litter box in the location where your cat has been
				eliminating. When she has consistently used this box for one month, you may gradually move
				it to a more convenient location at the rate of an inch per day.
			</p>
		</div>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Everyone makes mistakes">
		<p>
			If you catch your cat in the act of eliminating outside the litter box, do something to
			interrupt the cat like making a startling noise, but be careful not to scare him or her.
			Immediately take him or her to the litter box and set the cat on the floor nearby. If the car
			wanders over to the litter box, wait and praise the cat after he or she eliminates in the box.
			If the cat takes off in another direction, the cat may want privacy, so watch from afar until
			the cat goes back to the litter box and eliminates, then praise the cat when he or she does.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don’t ever punish your cat for eliminating outside of the litter box. By the time you find the
			soiled area, it’s too late to administer a correction. Do nothing but clean it up. rubbing
			your cat’s nose in it, taking him or her to the spot, and scolding the cat, or inflicting any
			other type of punishment will only make the cat afraid of your or afraid to eliminate in your
			presence. Animals don’t understand punishment after the fact, even if it’s only seconds later,
			and trying to punish them will often make matters worse.
