<Section title="Introducing your new cat to your other pets">
	<p>
		Some cats are more social than other cats. For example, an 8-year old cat who has never been
		around other animals may never learn to share her territory (and her people) with other pets in
		the household. But an 8-week old kitten separated from her mom and litter-mate for the first
		time might be glad to have a cat or dog companion.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cats are territorial and they need to be introduced to other animals very slowly so they can get
		used to each other before a face-to-face confrontation. Slow introductions help prevent fearful
		and aggressive problems from developing. Here are guidelines to help make the introductions go
		smoothly.
	</p>
	<SubSection title="Confinement">
		<p>
			Confine your new cat to one medium-sized room with her litter box, water and a bed. Feed your
			resident pets and the newcomer on each side of the door to this room, so that they associate
			something enjoyable (eating!) with each other’s smells. Gradually move the dishes closer to
			the door until your pet can eat calmly while standing directly on either side of the door.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="The old switcheroo">
		<p>
			Swap the sleeping blankets or beds used by all the cats so they each have a chance to become
			accustomed to the other cats’ scents. You can even rub a towel on one animal and put it
			underneath the food dish of another animal. Once your new cat is using his or her litter box
			and eating regularly while confined, let her have free time in the house while confining your
			other animals to the new cat’s room. This switch provides another way for the animals to
			experience each other’s scents without a face-to-face meeting. It also allows the newcomer to
			become familiar with her new surroundings without being frightened by the other animals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, after the animals have been returned to their original designed parts of the house, use
			two doorstops to prop open the dividing door just enough to allow the animals to see each
			other, and repeat the whole process over a period of days - supervised, of course.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Slow and steady wins the race">
		<p>
			It’s better to introduce your pets to each other gradually so that neither animal becomes
			afraid or aggressive. You can expect a mild protest from either cat from time to time but
			don’t allow these behaviors to intensify. If either animal becomes fearful or aggressive,
			separate them, and start the introduction process once again with a series of very small,
			gradual steps as outlined above.
		</p>
		<span class="text-[0.8rem] italic text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-200 pl-4">
			Note: When you introduce pets to each other, one of them may send “play” signals, which can be
			misinterpreted but the other pet as signs of aggression. If that’s the case, always handle the
			situation as “aggression” and seek professional help from a veterinarian or animal behaviorist
			right away.
		</span>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Precautionary measures">
		<p>
			Try to keep your resident pets schedules close to what they were before the newcomer’s
			arrival. Before bringing a new pet home, check with your veterinarian to be sure all your
			current pets are healthy. You’ll also want to have at least one litter box per cat in separate
			locations. Make sure that none of the cats are being “ambushed” by another while trying to use
			the litter box, and be sure each cat has a safe hiding place.
		</p>
		<p>
			If small spats (hissing, growling, or posturing) do occur between your cats, you shouldn’t
			attempt to intervene directly to separate the cats. Instead, make a loud noise, throw a
			pillow, or use a squirt bottle with water to separate the cats. Give them a chance to calm
			down before reintroducing them to each other.
		</p>
	</SubSection>
	<SubSection title="Cat-to-dog introductions">
		<p>
			You’ll need to be even more careful when introducing a dog and a cat to one another. A dog can
			seriously injure and even kill a cat very easily, even if they’re only playing-all it takes is
			one quick shake to break the cat’s neck. Some dogs have such a high prey drive that they
			should never be left alone with a cat. Dogs usually want to chase and play with cats, and cats
			usually become afraid and defensive. In addition to using the techniques described above to
			begin introducing your new cat to your resident dog, take these steps:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-none pl-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
			<li class="flex flex-col gap-0.5">
				<h5 class="text-base font-bold text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red">Practice Obedience</h5>
				<p>
					If your dog doesn’t already know the commands “sit,” “down,” “come,” and “stay,” begin
					working on them right away. Small pieces of food will increase your dog’s motivation to
					perform, which will be necessary in the presence of a strong distraction such as a new
					cat. Even if your dog already knows these commands, work to reinforce these commands in
					return for a tidbit.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="flex flex-col gap-0.5">
				<h5 class="text-base font-bold text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red">
					Set up controlled meetings
				</h5>
				<p>
					After your new cat and resident dog have become comfortable eating on opposite sides of
					the door and have been exposed to each other’s scents as described above, you can attempt
					a face-to-face introduction in a controlled manner. Put your dog’s leash on and have him
					or her either sit or lie down and stay for treats. Have a second person offer your cat
					some special pieces of food. At first, the cat and the dog should be on opposite side of
					the room. Lots of short visits are better than a few long visits. Don’t drag out the visit
					so long that the dog becomes uncontrollable. Repeat this step several times until both the
					cat and dog are tolerating each other’s presence without fear, aggression, or other
					undesirable behavior.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="flex flex-col gap-0.5">
				<h5 class="text-base font-bold text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red">Let your cat go</h5>
				<p>
					Next, allow your cat some freedom to explore your dog at her own pace, with the dog still
					on-leash and in a “down-stay.” Meanwhile, keep giving your dog treats and praise for his
					calm behavior. If your dog gets up from his “stay” position, he or she would be
					re-positioned with a treat lure and praised and rewarded for obeying the “stay” command.
					If your cat runs away or becomes aggressive, your progressing too fast. Go back to the
					previous introduction steps.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="flex flex-col gap-0.5">
				<h5 class="text-base font-bold text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red">
					Use positive reinforcement
				</h5>
				<p>
					Although your dog must be taught that chasing or being rough with your cat in unacceptable
					behavior, he must also be taught what is appropriate and be rewarded for those behaviors,
					such as sitting, coming when called, or lying down in return for a treat. If your dog is
					always punished when your cat is around and never has “good things” happen in the cat’s
					presence your dog may redirect aggression toward the cat.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="flex flex-col gap-0.5">
				<h5 class="text-base font-bold text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red">
					Directly supervise all interactions
				</h5>
				<p>
					You may want to keep your dog at your side and on-leash whenever your cat is free in the
					house during the introduction process. Be sure that your cat has an escape route and a
					place to hide and until you’re certain your cat will be safe be sure to keep the two
					separated when you aren’t home.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="flex flex-col gap-0.5">
				<h5 class="text-base font-bold text-ahhs-red-400 dark:text-ahhs-red">
					Kittens and puppies
				</h5>
				<p>
					Because they are so much smaller, kittens are in more danger of being injured or killed by
					a young energetic dog or by a predatory dog. A kitten will need to be kept separate from
					an especially energetic dog until she is fully grown, expect for period of supervised
					interaction to enable the animals to get to know each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even after the cat is fully grown, she may not be able to be safely left alone with the
					dog. usually, a well-socialized cat will be able to keep a puppy in his place, but some
					cats don’t have enough confidence to do this. If you have an especially shy cat, you might
					need to keep him or her separated from your puppy until he matures enough to have more
					self-control.

		<p>
			If introductions don’t go smoothly, seek professional advice immediately from a veterinarian
			or animal -behavior specialist. Animals can be severely injured in fights, and the longer the
			problems continues, the harder it can be to resolve. Punishment won’t work and could make
			things worse. Luckily, most conflicts between pets in the same family can often be resolved
			with professional guidance.
